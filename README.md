<h1>Artificial Intelligent Programming</h1>
The goal is to implement some really interesting concepts of the artificial intelligence programming to the real world scenarios. 

Programs done so far:
1.Search algorithms: Implement BFS, DFS and GBFS on a ATM graph.
2.BlocksWorld: Solve blocksworld problem using A* algorithm
3.Simulated Annealing: Using SA algorithm to solve the TSP problem for visiting 53 cities in Texas.
4.Constrain Satisfactions: Making CSP solver using backtracking and MRV heuristics.
