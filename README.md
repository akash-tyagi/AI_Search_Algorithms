<h1>Artificial Intelligent Programming</h1>
The goal is to implement some really interesting concepts of the artificial intelligence programming to the real world scenarios. 

Programs done so far:<br/>
1.Search algorithms: Implement BFS, DFS and GBFS on a ATM graph.<br/>
2.BlocksWorld: Solve blocksworld problem using A* algorithm.<br/>
3.Simulated Annealing: Using SA algorithm to solve the TSP problem for visiting 53 cities in Texas.<br/>
4.Constrain Satisfactions: Making CSP solver using backtracking and MRV heuristics.<br/>
5.Othello: Intelligent othello game playing using minimax and alpha-beta pruning.<br/>
6.Resolution Refutation: Solving Sammy's Sport shop problem by a propositional theorem using resolution refutation.<br/>
