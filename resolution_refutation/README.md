<h1>Propositional Theorem Prover using Resolution Refutation</h1>
The goal of this project is to implement a program that can be used to make inferences from propositional knowledge base.
ie. Given a set of sentences KB (Knowledge Base), determine whether query q is entailed by KB.<br />
<br/>
The KB and -q is read from a KB.txt file
<br />
Note: Please check the Readme.pdf for example game transcript/output.
